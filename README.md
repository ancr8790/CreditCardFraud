# CreditCardFraud
This project attempts to implement Credit Card Fraud Detection using Supervised Machine Learning. In this repository one will find source code for analysis in a Jupyter Notebook, PowerPoint slides used to document findings, and video recording of presentation. 

Through implementation and optimization of different machine learning models, it was determined that the best model given this analysis for predicting transactions as credit card fraud is a Standardized K Nearest Neighbor model with the hyperparameter of the neighbors set to 8.
